Air Pollution Detector (Luyahan,Ishikura,Lindo)Construct a manufacturing device through software that can detect air pollution and will trigger an alarm if polluted air is monitored around the area. If the pollutant level exceeds the limited threshold value, the buzzer will automatically be on. MQ135 sensor will be used as the air quality sensor as it can detect the most harmful gases and can measure the amount accurately. The amount will be displayed on the LCD.
