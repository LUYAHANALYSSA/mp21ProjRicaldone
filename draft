Abstract:

This research will tackle the brief history of computers and microprocessors. It will be focusing on the evolution of the microprocessors and the computer system amidst the world-shattering Covid-19 pandemic. This research will be answering the questions how the manufacturers were affected economically and on what ends do the manufacturers have to take in order to further develop computers in situations mostly unknown to them.

Topic:
The effect of Covid-19 to the manufacturing of microprocessors.
The effect of Covid-19 to the evolution of microprocessors.
The economic effect of Covid-19 to the manufacturers.
